The [Connect Systems CS7000 M17 Plus](https://www.connectsystems.com/amateur-products/CS7000-M17-plus.html) is a radio that supports DMR and M17. The [CS7000 M17 PLUS CPS](https://www.connectsystems.com/amateur-software/CS7000_m17_plus_software.html) allows you to import digital contacts, channels, and zones from Excel spreadsheets. I wrote an application to convert a codeplug from the Anytone 878UVII Plus radio (CPS 3.04 through 4.0) into the spreadsheets that can be imported into the CS7000 CPS. The application is available as a stand-alone executable and is compatible with 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. Windows 7 is not supported. 

## Where to find the CS7000 Codeplug Converter application 
You can download the software at the following URL

[CS7000 Convert GUI v1.3.1.zip](https://github.com/VikingNation/CS7000_convert_gui/releases/download/v1.3.1/CS7000_convert_gui-v1.3.1.zip) (sha256:a7591d3cddec186c0521023272165266125cc20030f8885edb44edb9fd8be350)

### Verify the integrity of the executable
Verify the checksum of the executable file. You can use my PGP public key along with the digital signature in the ZIP file.

After unzipping the file, you will find the executable along with a digital signature (.sig) file. Use GNU Privacy Guard (GNUPG) and the signature file to verify the integrity of the executable. I digitally signed the executable in the ZIP file with my PGP key. Here is the link to [my public GnuPG key](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=K3JSJ%40arrl.net&fingerprint=on&op=index). Download the key associated with my email address and import into GnuPg. Use the GnuPg software to verify the signature.

### Where to get the source code
Source code for the most recent version, v1.3.1, is available on the following GitHub repository [CS7000_convert_gui (v1.3.1)](https://github.com/VikingNation/CS7000_convert_gui/releases/tag/v1.3.1)
 
## How to use the software
See the user guide in the docs directory in ZIP file for directions on using the program.
