IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) Check-ins who do not use a VarAC EMAIL GATEWAY will not be counted.

2) You must be on V11.0.7 or greater. Be sure to check Send to Email in the VMAIL dialog box.

3) YOU DO NOT NEED AN EMAIL GATEWAY ON YOUR INSTALLATION OF VARAC TO CHECK IN! You will be using the GATEWAY of the beacon displaying the "link" icon that you connect with.

4) V12.0 is now available! V12 supports many new features. Please consider upgrading.

5) Check in Wednesday in your local time. If it's Wednesday for you, it works for me.
