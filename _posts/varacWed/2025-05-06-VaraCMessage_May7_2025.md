Since tomorrow is the first Wednesday of the month, a weather report is requested but not required. The emphasis is on brevity and communicating the information rather than applying a strict format. Please use the standard check-in format (the first line) if you don't use the weather format.

May 7 from 0000-2359 EDT


Two more VarAC caps will be awarded to random check-ins. Previous winners are not eligible.
