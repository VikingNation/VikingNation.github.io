Detailed instructions in Recent Files in this Group, on the KB0US QRZ page, or the varac-hamradio forum.



IMPORTANT NOTES:
1) Check-ins who do not use a VarAC EMAIL GATEWAY will not be counted.
2) You must be on V11.0.7 or greater. Be sure to check Send to Email in the VMAIL dialog box.
3) YOU DO NOT NEED AN EMAIL GATEWAY ON YOUR INSTALLATION OF VARAC TO CHECK IN! You will be using the GATEWAY of the beacon displaying the "link" icon that you connect with.
4) V11.4.0 is now available! Canned messages are now available in the VMAIL dialog box making participation in VarAC Wednesday even easier!
5) Check in Wednesday in your local time. If it's Wednesday for you, it works for me.
73,
Jason K3JSJ



73 and see you on the waterfall!
