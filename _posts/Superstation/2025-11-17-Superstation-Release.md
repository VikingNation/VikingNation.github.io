I am pleased to announce the public release of Superstation - a global ham radio game!

The purpose of the Superstation game is to increase the number of VarAC QSOs and to encourage more DX activity. A typical game will run over multiple weeks although a game can be run at any length. Superstation is different from any other amateur radio contest. There is an element of a card & dice game, promoting QSOs that are more than simple exchanges, and demonstrating the DX capabilities of the mode. All amateurs around the world are invited to participate. Superstation is integrated into VarAC via the VarAC.db file allowing Superstation to read information about contacts you've made. The game does not use beacons in any way. But we do use Broadcast. Check-out the walk-through videos above to see details how the Broadcast feature is used by Superstation.
