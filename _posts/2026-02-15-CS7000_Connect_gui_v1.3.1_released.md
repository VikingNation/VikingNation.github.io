I’m pleased to announce the release of **CS7000 Code Plug Converter v1.3.1**, a major update that significantly expands the converter’s capabilities and improves the overall user experience. This version works with Anytone code plugs from Anytone 878UVII Plus CPS 3.04 through 4.0. This version introduces support for both **Direct** and **Table** ID population methods, enhanced validation, UI improvements, and better integration with the latest CS7000 firmware and CPS.

# 🚀 New Features

This is a **major update** of the CS7000 Codeplug Converter software.

### **Anytone 878UVII Plus CPS 3.04 through 4.0 Support (New)**
The software now successfully converts Anytone codeplugs from Anytone 878UVII Plus CPS revision 3.04 through 4.0.

### **Direct Method (New)**
At the request of Jerry from Connect Systems, the converter now supports writing IDs (TalkGroups / Contacts) directly into the channel configuration using the **Direct method**.  
This feature is supported in:

- **Firmware:** 9.00.93  
- **CPS:** 1.2.19.00BETA  

Under this method:

- The ID is written directly into the channel  
- The converter determines whether the contact type is **Private** or **Group**  
- The converter outputs a **CS7000_contacts.xlsx** file  

### **Table Method (Enhanced)**
The converter also supports the **Table method**, where:

- The TX Alias is set to the “Name” of the TalkGroup/Contact  
- The radio looks up the name in the Contacts database  
- The converter outputs a **CS7000_contacts.xlsx** file  

⚠ **Important Note:**  
If you already have entries in your CS7000 codeplug and you import the generated `CS7000_contacts.xlsx`, the CPS will **overwrite all existing contacts**.
