title: CS7000 Converter - Anytone codeplug converter
---

A friend, Rob (KC3WUT), asked me to help him setup his new Connect System CS7000 M17 PLUS radio over the Christmas/New Year Holiday.  The CPS for this radio provides a capability to import digital contacts, channels, and zones.  I wrote a program that allows operators to convert exported CSV files from the Anytone CPS software into Excel spreadsheets that can be imported into the CS7000 CPS.
