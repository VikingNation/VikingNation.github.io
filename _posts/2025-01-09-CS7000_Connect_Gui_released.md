title: CS7000 Converter - Anytone codeplug converter
---

A friend, Rob (KC3WUT), asked me to help him setup his new Connect System CS7000 M17 PLUS radio over the Christmas/New Year Holiday.  The CPS for this radio provides a capability to import digital contacts, channels, and zones.  I wrote a program that allows operators to convert exported CSV files from the Anytone CPS software into Excel spreadsheets.  You can import those spreadsheets into CS7000 M17 PLUS CPS and program the radio's DMR mode.  You can use this program to quickly get up and running.
